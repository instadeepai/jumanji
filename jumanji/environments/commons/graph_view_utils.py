    Compute a 2D spring layout for the given graph using
    the Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed algorithm.

    The algorithm computes a layout by simulating the graph as a physical system,
    where nodes are repelling each other and edges are attracting connected nodes.
    The method minimizes the energy of the system over several iterations.

    Args:
        graph: A Graph object representing the adjacency matrix of the graph.
        num_nodes: Number of graph nodes.
        seed: An integer used to seed the random number generator for reproducibility.

        A list of tuples representing the 2D positions of nodes in the graph.
