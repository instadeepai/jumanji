    the nearest neighbour, with each cell representing a ray angle
    (with `num_vision` rays evenly distributed over the agents
    field of vision).

    For example if an agent sees another agent straight ahead and
    `num_vision = 5` then the observation array could be

    ```
    [-1.0, -1.0, 0.5, -1.0, -1.0]
