</p>

We provide here a Jax JIT-able implementation of the _Rubik's cube_. The environment contains an
implementation of the classic 3x3x3 cube by default, and configurably other sizes. The goal of the
agent is to match all stickers on each face to a single colour. On resetting the environment the
cube will be randomly scrambled with a configurable number of turns (by default 100).


## Observation
The observation given to the agent gives a view of the current state of the cube,

- `cube`: jax array (int8) of shape `(6, cube_size, cube_size)` whose values are in
    `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` (corresponding to the different sticker colors). The indices of the array
    specify the sticker position - first the face (in the order _up_, _front_, _right_, _back_,
    _left_, _down_) and then the row and column. Note that the orientation of each face is as
    follows:

    - UP: LEFT face on the left and BACK face pointing up

    - FRONT: LEFT face on the left and UP face pointing up

    - RIGHT: FRONT face on the left and UP face pointing up

    - BACK: RIGHT face on the left and UP face pointing up

    - LEFT: BACK face on the left and UP face pointing up

    - DOWN: LEFT face on the left and FRONT face pointing up

- `step_count`: jax array (int32) of shape `()`, representing the number of steps in the episode
thus far.


## Action
The action space is a `MultiDiscreteArray`, specifically a tuple of an index between 0 and 5 (since
there are 6 faces), an index between 0 and `cube_size//2` (the number of possible depths), and an
index between 0 and 2 (3 possible directions). An action thus consists of three pieces of
information:

- Face to turn,

- Depth of the turn (possible depths are between `0` representing the outer layer and `cube_size//2`
representing the layer closest to the middle),

- Direction of turn (possible directions are clockwise, anti-clockwise, or a half turn).


## Reward
The reward function is configurable, but by default is the fully sparse reward giving `+1` for
solving the cube and otherwise `0`. The episode terminates if either the cube is solved or a
configurable horizon (by default `200`) is reached.


## Registered Versions ðŸ“–
- `RubiksCube-v0`, the standard Rubik's Cube [puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube)
with faces of size 3x3.

- `RubiksCube-partly-scrambled-v0`, an easier version of the standard Rubik's Cube puzzle with faces
of size 3x3 yet only 7 scrambles at reset time, making it technically maximum 7 actions away from
the solution.
