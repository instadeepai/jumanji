We provide here a JAX jit-able implementation of the [Multi-Agent Cleaning](https://github.com/Bigpig4396/Multi-Agent-Reinforcement-Learning-Environment#multi-agent-cleaner)
environment.

In this environment, multiple agents must cooperatively clean the floor of a room with complex
indoor barriers (black). At the beginning of an episode, the whole floor is dirty (green).
Every time an agent (red) visits a dirty tile, it is cleaned (white).

The goal is to clean as many tiles as possible in a given time budget.

A new maze is randomly generated using a recursive division method for each new episode. Agents
always start in the top left corner of the maze.


## Observation
The **observation** seen by the agent is a `NamedTuple` containing the following:

- `grid`: jax array (int8) of shape `(num_rows, num_cols)`, array representing the grid, each tile is
    either dirty (0), clean (1), or a wall (2).

- `agents_locations`: jax array (int) of shape `(num_agents, 2)`, array specifying the x and y
    coordinates of every agent.

- `action_mask`: jax array (bool) of shape `(num_agents, 4)`, array specifying, for each agent,
    which action (up, right, down, left) is legal.

- `step_count`: jax array (int32) of shape `()`, number of steps elapsed in the current episode.


## Action
The action space is a `MultiDiscreteArray` containing an integer value in `[0, 1, 2, 3]` for each
agent. Each agent can take one of four actions: up (`0`), right (`1`), down (`2`), or left (`3`).

The episode terminates if any agent meets one of the following conditions:

- An invalid action is taken, or

- An action is blocked by a wall.

In both cases, the agent's position remains unchanged.


## Reward
The reward is global and shared among the agents. It is equal to the number of tiles which were
cleaned during the time step, minus a penalty (0.5 by default) to encourage agents to clean the
maze faster.


## Registered Versions ðŸ“–
- `Cleaner-v0`, a room of size 10x10 with 3 agents.
